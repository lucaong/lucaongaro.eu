This blog post is to introduce
[MiniSearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch), a JavaScript library that
provides **client-side fulltext search** capabilities. It has zero runtime
dependencies, and uses a space optimized index to support memory constrained
environments like mobile browsers. It offers **prefix search**, **fuzzy match**,
**boosting**, **auto suggestions**, and many of the features expected from a
server-side search engine like Solr or Elastic Search.

**MiniSearch** is designed to be flexible and easy to use, and I think that a
quick example can introduce it better than a long explanation:

```javascript
// A collection of documents we want to search
const documents = [
  { id: 1, title: 'Moby Dick', text: 'Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...' },
  { id: 2, title: 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance', text: 'I can see by my watch...' },
  { id: 3, title: 'Neuromancer', text: 'The sky above the port was...' },
  { id: 4, title: 'Zen and the Art of Archery', text: 'At first sight it must seem...' },
  // ...and more
]

// Create the search engine, and set `title` and `text` as searchable fields
let miniSearch = new MiniSearch({ fields: ['title', 'text'] })

// Index all documents (this is fast!)
miniSearch.addAll(documents)

// Search with default options. It will return the id of the matching documents,
// along with a relevance score and match information
miniSearch.search('zen art motorcycle')
// => [ { id: 2, score: 2.77258, match: { ... } }, { id: 4, score: 1.38629, match: { ... } } ]

// Search only within specific fields
miniSearch.search('zen', { fields: ['title'] })

// Boost some fields to give them more importance (here "title")
miniSearch.search('zen', { boost: { title: 2 } })

// Prefix search (so that 'moto' will match 'motorcycle')
miniSearch.search('moto', { prefix: true })

// Fuzzy search, in this example, with a max edit distance of 0.2 * term length.
// The mispelled 'ismael' will match 'ishmael'.
miniSearch.search('ismael', { fuzzy: 0.2 })

// Get suggestions for a partial search
miniSearch.autoSuggest('zen ar')
// => [ { suggestion: 'zen archery art', terms: [ 'zen', 'archery', 'art' ], score: 1.73332 },
//      { suggestion: 'zen art', terms: [ 'zen', 'art' ], score: 1.21313 } ]
```

Here is a small demo application to play with, and experiment with different
options:

<iframe src='https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/examples/'
style='border: none; background: #fafafa; box-shadow: 0 1px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
border-radius: 5px; width: 100%; height: 440px; margin: 1em 0;'></iframe>

As can be tested in the demo, the **~5000 songs** are indexed client-side upon
each page load in a fraction of a second, and the search happens in **real
time** as the user types, with no detectable latency.


## What's the point of a client-side search engine?

Recently, for a web application I was working on, I needed to allow users to
search for products in the inventory of several resellers. Each of these
resellers typically offers a few thousands of products. The app needed to offer
advanced fulltext features like **fuzzy match** (finding results also when a
term does not match exactly, for example due to a mispell), **prefix search**
(searching for the initial part of a term should already yield results before
the whole word is typed in), and proper **ranking of results** (more relevant
results should appear first).

Normally, for such use cases, a search engine like **Solr** or **ElasticSearch**
would be the obvious choice. The challenge though, was to make the search
feature as fast as possible, but also resilient to spotty Internet connections
on users' smartphones. I started to think whether it would make sense to
implement the search index **client-side instead of server-side**: it might
sound a bit unorthodox, but if possible at all, it would have given us several
advantages.

First, once the index is loaded, a temporary interruption of the Internet
connectivity would not affect the search experience: if the search index lives
on the client side, **no network request is necessary**. Moreover, there would
be no need to setup and run a search server, making the architecture simpler.
Running the search engine client-side is also **inherently scalable**: no
additional load is placed on the server when more users access the platform, as
each of them is running their own instance of the search engine in their
browser. Finally, if the implementation is efficient, search can be made much
faster, as network latency is eliminated entirely, so results can be computed in
real time as the user types.

Of course, there are limits to how big a collection of documents can be in order
to fit in the browser memory, but with a good implementation these limits are
**surprisingly high**. This enables interesting use cases, like searching within
a mobile application, or through an address book, in ways that yield much better
results than a crude search with a regular expression.

## Implementing the index

On the other hand, is it really possible to efficiently index and store
thousands of documents in the browser memory? As it turns out, if the index is
implemented in a space efficient way, and the documents to store are not too
large, **the answer is yes**. As a rough calculation, if we have 5000 documents
to search amongst, and each document is on average 200 characters long (maybe we
are only iterested in searching by title, or within a small description), then
storing all the documents in uncompressed form takes roughly 2MB (JavaScript
strings are typically stored using 2 bytes per character). Now, 2MB is of the
same order of dimension of a good quality image, and usually more than
acceptable to store in memory.

There is one problem with this calculation though: it is only taking into
account the size of the raw documents, not of the search index data. Typical
implementations of inverse indexes for full-text search, **trade off space
utilization for lookup efficiency**, and therefore take a lot more space than
the original documents. This is not a problem for search engines running
server-side, where data can be stored on disk, and also RAM is plenty, but it is
not acceptable if the index data has to live in the browser memory. Can we
devise a data structure that is **at the same time compact and efficient**?

Luckily, there are some good candidates. One data structure that fits our
requirements particularily well, and therefore the one I ended up choosing, is
the [radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree): it is a variant of a
prefix tree that further optimizes space by merging nodes that are the only
children with their parent. A radix tree is a great candidate for our space
constrained inverted index because:

  1. It supports **efficient lookup** of a term, in time proportional to the
     length of the term being searched. The same holds for insertion and
     deletion.
  2. Being it a prefix tree, searching for all terms **having a certain prefix**
     is also efficient, and takes time proportional to the length of the prefix.
  3. The data structure is compact, because **common prefixes are stored only
     once**. Because of that, in some cases the index could even be smaller than
     the original collection of documents. In general, the index size will be of
     the same order of dimension as the size of the collection of documents.
  4. **"Fuzzy" search**, which is searching for terms within a maximum [edit
     distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) from a given term,
     can also be implemented. It cannot be as efficient as in other techniques
     like [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) indexes, but for small
     edit distances it can be made efficient enough. Also, as the search happens
     client-side, it makes sense to use a bit more CPU, while keeping the index
     smaller. Other data structures allowing for efficient fuzzy search would
     take a lot more space.

Implementing a radix tree in JavaScript is not trivial, but with some patience
and a good amount of testing it is well worth (and also quite enjoyable if you
are a data structures enthusiast like me). The radix tree implementation ended
up taking [less than 300 lines of
code](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch/blob/master/src/SearchableMap/SearchableMap.js),
and is [thoroughfully
tested](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch/blob/master/src/SearchableMap/SearchableMap.test.js),
including some generative **property based tests**, that I find especially
valuable in algorithmic code in order to discover unforeseen corner cases.

Building on the robust foundations of the radix tree implementation, the search
engine itself was mostly a matter of building up the index in a way that
supports all the planned features (boosting, search in a specific field, etc.),
and following well researched ranking algorithms like
[Tf-Idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf). The most complicated part was
implementing fuzzy search, which is done by traversing the radix tree while
maintaining a "budget" of edits: if we are looking for the word "color" within
an edit distance of 2, we will find "colour" (edit distance 1), and "connor"
(edit distance 2), but not "colorful" (edit distance 3, exceeding budget).

A suite of [performance
benchmarks](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch/tree/master/benchmarks) also
provides a convenient way to measure performance improvements and avoid
regressions. Measuring performance in a standardized way is especially important
for algorithmic code, where it is otherwise too common to make the mistake of
implementing "optimizations" that obfuscate the code while not giving any
tangible benefit.

## Comparison with other libraries

**MiniSearch** is not the only library of its kind. There are a few other
libraries with similar goals, among which [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com),
[Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io). These libraries are well implemented, and allthough
they all provide client-side fulltext search, they have different use cases and
feature sets.

**Fuse.js** is optimized for smaller collections of documents: it uses the
[Bitap algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitap_algorithm), that provides
good fuzzy matching, but requires to iterate the whole collection for each
search. For this reason it was not ideal for my use case, in which I can easily
have more than ten thousand documents to search among.

**Lunr.js** is probably the most similar library. It is well implemented, and
uses an approach which is quite similar to MiniSearch. The project is well
maintained, and I can definitely recommend it (I also contributed a pull request
to the library, and the maintainer is nice and responsive). The notable
differences with MiniSearch are the following:

  1. MiniSearch index takes **sensibly less space** than Lunr's one. On my
     applications, it typically uses up 40% of the space used by Lunr, for the
     same collection. This was one of the main design goals of MiniSearch, to
     support memory-constrained cases like mobile apps. That said, Lunr is
     already quite space optimized, so for many use cases this difference won't
     be too important.
  2. Lunr comes with **stemming and language support**. MiniSearch provides the
     facilities to add those, but does not provide them out of the box.
     Stemming and language support are useful features, but they are often not
     needed, make the library bigger, and can lead to confusing results. For
     these reasons, I chose to leave them out of scope for MiniSearch, and
     explain instead in the docs how to add them, if needed. That said, if you
     know you need them, Lunr might be an easier choice.
  3. Lunr index cannot be changed after creation. MiniSearch instead makes it
     possible to **add and remove documents** to the index at any moment. If
     dynamic updates to the index are necessary (that was my case), then
     MiniSearch can be a good option.
  4. Lunr provides an **advanced query language** that can express some queries
     that are not possible in MiniSearch (for example, searching for terms that
     start with "uni" and end with "ty", like "unity" and "university"). On the
     other hand, if you do not need those, you might find MiniSearch API simpler
     to use.
  5. MiniSearch offers **auto-suggestions** out of the box, to complete partial
     queries. For example, for the partial search "uni", it can suggest
     "university", "unicorn", etc. The suggestions are calculated on the actual
     documents, and ranked by relevance. This can be used to implement
     auto-completion, like in the demo application shown above. Lunr does not
     currently offer this feature.

Notably, MiniSearch, Lunr, and Fuse.js all come with zero runtime dependencies,
which is quite a good surprise for a JavaScript package!

## Conclusion

I hope I managed to give a good enough introduction to client-side fulltext
search, its advantages and disadvantages, and the design decisions behind
**MiniSearch**. I had quite some fun implementing this library, and it is by now
successfully used in production on way more use cases than I initially
forecasted. It was also a nice experience to read through other implementations,
and contribute to them: it is interesting how each library came to some
different ingenious solution to this tricky problem.

If you are considering to adopt MiniSearch for a project, you might want to read
through the [documentation](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/) and the [API
reference](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/class/src/MiniSearch.js~MiniSearch.html).
